RAM is fast and inexpensive, but it is also **volatile**, which means that when the program ends, or the computer shuts down, data in RAM disappears. To make data available the next time the computer is turned on and the program is started, it has to be written to a non-volatile storage medium, such a hard drive, usb drive, or CD-RW.\n",

They can read the whole notebook in its natural order or they can skip around.\n",
